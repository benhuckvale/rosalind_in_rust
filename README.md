Rosalind in Rust
================

Solutions to http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/ implemented in Rust.

Each solution is just an .rs in the top level directory, to be compiled trivially like this:
```
rustc counting_dna_nucleotides.rs
```

More structured variants of some solutions, that involve crates and are built
via cargo and in the 'projects' folder.
